The string is a comma-separated list of expressions (expression-1, expression-2, ...)

An expression is either of followings:

Table name: if the expression does not include special characters like . or *, it’s a table name. It’s identical to TABLE_NAME.*.

Pattern with “*”: if the expression includes special characters, it’s a matching rule, where * matches with any strings.

!expression: if the expression starts with !, it negates the following expression, where the expression is either of above.","Examples: customers, behavior_pageviews, behavior_clicks = All columns of customers, behavior_pageviews, and behavior_clicks tables.

customers.*, behavior_pageviews.*, behavior_clicks.* = All columns of customers, behavior_pageviews, and behavior_clicks tables.

customers.*, !customers.time, behavior_*.*, products.{id,name}, !*.email = All columns except “time” of customers table, all columns of all behavior tables, and id and name columns of products table. But exclude all “email” columns from all tables."
