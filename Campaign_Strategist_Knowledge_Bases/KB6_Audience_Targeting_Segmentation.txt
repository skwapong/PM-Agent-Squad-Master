## AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORKS

### RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
**Recency:** How recently customer made purchase
**Frequency:** How often customer purchases
**Monetary:** How much customer spends

**RFM Segments:**
- Champions: High R, F, M (best customers, highest value)
- Loyal Customers: High F, M (regular purchasers, high value)

- Promising: Mid R, F, M (potential to upgrade)
- Customers Needing Attention: Mid R, F, M but declining (re-engagement needed)
- At Risk: Low R, high F, M (previously valuable, now disengaged)
- Can't Lose Them: Low R, very high F, M (churning VIPs, urgent re-engagement)
- Hibernating: Low R, F, M (long inactive, reactivation campaigns)
- Lost: Lowest R, F, M (win-back or suppress)

**Campaign Applications:**
- Champions: VIP programs, beta access, referral incentives

## ADVANCED TARGETING TACTICS

### Audience Stacking & Layering
**AND Logic (Narrowing):**
- Interest A + Interest B + Demographic C
- Example: "Fitness" AND "Healthy Eating" AND "Age 25-40"
- Creates highly specific but smaller audience
- Higher relevance, lower reach

**OR Logic (Expanding):**
- Interest A OR Interest B OR Interest C
- Example: "Running" OR "Cycling" OR "Yoga"
- Creates broader audience with related interests
- Lower precision, higher reach

**Exclusion Targeting:**
- Include A EXCLUDE B
- Example: "Fitness apparel" EXCLUDE "Already purchased"
- Refines audience by removing irrelevant segments

### Sequential Targeting (Funnel Strategy)
**Step 1: Cold Prospecting (Week 1-2)**
- Audience: Broad interest/demographic targeting, lookalikes 5-10%
- Objective: Awareness, reach
- Content: Educational, entertaining, brand story
- Metrics: Reach, CPM, video views, engagement

**Step 2: Warm Consideration (Week 2-4)**
- Audience: Video viewers (50%+), page engagers, website visitors
- Objective: Consideration, traffic
- Content: Product benefits, comparisons, testimonials
- Metrics: CTR, landing page views, time on site

**Step 3: Conversion Push (Week 3-5)**
- Audience: Add to cart, high-intent engagers, product viewers
- Objective: Conversions
- Content: Strong offers, urgency, social proof
- Metrics: CVR, CPA, ROAS

**Step 4: Retention (Ongoing)**
- Audience: Recent purchasers, customers
- Objective: Repeat purchase, loyalty
- Content: Cross-sells, new products, loyalty rewards
- Metrics: Repeat purchase rate, LTV, retention rate

### Testing Framework for Audiences
**Controlled A/B Testing:**
- Test one variable at a time
- Equal budget split
- Run for statistical significance (minimum 7 days, 100+ conversions)
- Variables to test:
  - Broad vs. narrow targeting
  - Interest A vs. Interest B
  - Lookalike 1% vs. 3% vs. 5%
  - Custom audience vs. lookalike
  - Expanded targeting on vs. off

**Champion/Challenger Approach:**
- Keep proven audience (champion) at 70% budget
- Test new audience (challenger) at 30% budget
- Promote challenger to champion if outperforms by 20%+
- Continuously cycle new challengers

**Holdout Testing (Incrementality):**
- Divide audience: Test group (sees ads) vs. Control group (doesn't see ads)
- Measure conversion lift in test group vs. control
- Calculates true incremental impact of ads
- Available through platform tools (Meta, Google)

## AUDIENCE SIZING GUIDELINES

### Minimum Audience Sizes
**Meta:**
- Awareness campaigns: 50,000+ people
- Traffic campaigns: 10,000+ people
- Conversion campaigns: 1,000 minimum, 50,000+ optimal
- Lookalike source: 100 minimum, 1,000+ optimal

**Pinterest:**
- All campaigns: 1,000+ people recommended
- Actalike source: 100 minimum
- Optimal actalike source: 500-10,000 people

**Google Display:**
- Remarketing lists: 100 people minimum for Search, 1,000 for Display
- Similar audiences: 1,000 source audience minimum
- Customer Match: 1,000 minimum (5,000+ recommended)

### Balancing Scale vs. Precision
**Narrow Targeting (High precision, low scale):**
- Multiple layered targeting criteria
- Specific interests + demographics + behaviors
- Use when: High-value products, niche audiences, limited budget
- Challenges: Limited scale, higher costs, audience saturation

**Broad Targeting (Low precision, high scale):**
- Minimal targeting restrictions
- Leverage platform algorithms (Advantage+, Performance Max)
- Use when: Mass market products, large budgets, strong pixel data
- Challenges: Less control, requires strong creative/offer, needs conversion volume

**Balanced Approach:**
- Start narrow, expand gradually based on performance
- Use broad targeting for top of funnel, narrow for bottom
- Layer retargeting on proven cold audiences
- Test expansion features on well-performing campaigns

## AUDIENCE INSIGHTS & OPTIMIZATION

### Analyzing Audience Performance
**Breakdown Analysis (Meta):**
- Age & gender performance
- Geographic performance (country, state, city)
- Placement performance
- Device performance (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Platform performance (Facebook, Instagram, Audience Network)

**Demographics Report (Google Ads):**
- Age and gender performance
- Household income performance (top 10%, 11-20%, etc.)
- Parental status performance

**Optimization Actions:**
- Increase bids on top-performing segments
- Create separate campaigns for high-performers
- Exclude poor-performing demographics
- Shift budget to best-performing geos/ages
- Create tailored creative for top segments

### Audience Refresh Strategy
**Remarketing Refreshes:**
- Expand time windows if audience too small (7 days → 30 days)
- Narrow windows if audience too broad or fatigued (90 days → 30 days)
- Create graduated messaging by time window (0-7d, 8-30d, 31-90d)

**Lookalike/Similar Audience Refreshes:**
- Update source audiences monthly with new customers
- Test different similarity percentages quarterly
- Create lookalikes from different source segments (high AOV, frequent, recent)
- Refresh exclusions to prevent audience overlap

**Interest/Keyword Refreshes:**
- Add new interests/keywords based on search term reports monthly
- Remove poor performers after 30 days of data
- Seasonal updates (45 days before key seasons)
- Test new trends and emerging interests

### Audience Fatigue Management
**Indicators of Fatigue:**
- Declining CTR (>20% drop)
- Rising frequency (>5 impressions/person)
- Increasing CPA
- Decreasing ROAS
- Lower engagement rates

**Mitigation Tactics:**
- Refresh creative every 2-4 weeks
- Expand audience size
- Reduce daily budget to limit impressions
- Shorten remarketing windows
- Create frequency caps (Meta: limit 3-5 impressions/week)
- Implement ad rotation schedules
- Take "creative breaks" (pause 1 week, relaunch)
