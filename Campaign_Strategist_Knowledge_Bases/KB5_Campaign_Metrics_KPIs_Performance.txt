## METRICS FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
Marketing campaign success requires tracking the right metrics at each stage of the customer journey. This knowledge base provides comprehensive metrics definitions, benchmarks, and strategic guidance for measuring digital campaign performance.

## FUNNEL-BASED METRICS ORGANIZATION

### AWARENESS STAGE METRICS

**Impressions:**

- Note: Does not indicate engagement or viewability

**Reach:**
- Definition: Number of unique users who saw ads
- Purpose: Measure audience breadth
- Calculation: Unique impressions
- Platform availability: Meta, Pinterest, Google Display/Video
- Target: Maximize unique reach while managing frequency

**Frequency:**
- Definition: Average number of times each person saw ads
- Purpose: Monitor ad fatigue and overexposure
- Calculation: Impressions ÷ Reach
- Optimal range: 1-3 for most campaigns, up to 5 for complex products
- Warning sign: >5 frequency often indicates ad fatigue
- Platform availability: Meta, Pinterest, Google Display

**Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM):**
- Definition: Cost to reach 1,000 impressions
- Purpose: Efficiency of awareness/reach campaigns

- Calculation: (Average Purchase Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan)
- Purpose: Determine sustainable acquisition costs
- Rule of thumb: CAC should be ≤ 1/3 of LTV

- Consideration campaign: CTR, CPC, Engagement Rate, Landing Page Views
- Conversion campaign: CVR, CPA, ROAS, Revenue

**Primary vs. Secondary KPIs:**

- Example for e-commerce conversion campaign:
  - Primary: ROAS
  - Secondary: CPA, CVR, AOV, CTR

### Benchmark Setting
**Internal Benchmarks:**
- Historical performance from past campaigns
- Performance trends over time
- Seasonal variations

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Research industry averages
- Adjust for business model differences
- Consider as directional, not absolute targets

**Competitive Benchmarks:**
- Auction insights (Google)
- Competitive intelligence tools
- Market positioning considerations

### Performance Evaluation Framework
**Traffic Light System:**
- Green: Exceeding targets (>110% of goal)
- Yellow: Meeting targets (90-110% of goal)
- Red: Below targets (<90% of goal)

**Performance Scoring:**
Evaluate campaigns on multiple dimensions:
1. Efficiency (CPA, ROAS, CPC relative to benchmarks)
2. Volume (conversion/lead volume vs. goals)
3. Quality (lead quality, repeat purchase rate, AOV)
4. Consistency (performance stability over time)

## ATTRIBUTION & MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES

### Multi-Touch Attribution
**Attribution Models:**
- Last-Click: All credit to final touchpoint (undervalues awareness)
- First-Click: All credit to initial touchpoint (ignores nurturing)
- Linear: Equal credit across touchpoints (oversimplifies)
- Time-Decay: More credit to recent interactions (balanced approach)
- Position-Based: Most credit to first and last (40/40/20 split)
- Data-Driven: ML-based credit assignment (most accurate with sufficient data)

**Cross-Platform Attribution:**
- Challenges: Platform walled gardens, different attribution windows, last-click bias
- Solutions: Use platform-specific attribution windows, Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), incrementality testing
- Best practice: Triangulate data from multiple sources

### iOS 14.5+ Privacy Considerations
**Impact on Tracking:**
- Reduced Facebook Pixel effectiveness
- Limited attribution windows (7-day click, 1-day view)
- Delayed reporting (up to 72 hours)
- Aggregated data (less granular audience insights)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement Conversions API (CAPI) for server-side tracking
- Verify domain in Business Manager
- Configure 8 prioritized conversion events per domain
- Focus on broader audiences (reduced effectiveness of granular targeting)
- Longer attribution windows for consideration
- Use holdout tests to measure incrementality

### Data Hygiene & Accuracy
**Tracking Verification:**
- Test conversion tracking in staging environments
- Use browser extensions (Meta Pixel Helper, Google Tag Assistant)
- Regular audit of tag implementations
- Monitor for tracking discrepancies

**Data Reconciliation:**
- Expect 10-20% discrepancy between platforms and analytics
- Understand different counting methodologies
- Platform data: Last-click within attribution window
- Analytics data: May use different attribution model
- Use consistent time zones across platforms
