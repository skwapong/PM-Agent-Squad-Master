# KNOWLEDGE BASE 9B: TIKTOK ADVERTISING BEST PRACTICES (PART 2 OF 2)

## TIKTOK CREATIVE BEST PRACTICES

### The 3-Second Rule
**Hook Immediately:**
- First 3 seconds determine if user continues watching
- 70% of users decide to skip within 3 seconds
- Show product/brand/value proposition immediately
- Use pattern interrupts (unexpected visuals, sounds, text)
- Start with action, not setup

**Effective Hooks:**
- Ask compelling question
- Make surprising statement
- Show dramatic visual
- Use trending sound/music
- Jump into action immediately
- Bold text overlay with benefit

### Authenticity & Native Content
**TikTok-First Creative:**
- Looks and feels like organic TikTok content
- Raw, unpolished aesthetic outperforms high production
- User-generated content (UGC) style
- Creator-led content (not obvious ads)
- Mobile-shot, authentic feel

**Avoid:**
- Overly polished, commercial-looking ads
- Obvious product placement without context
- Recycled Instagram/Facebook content
