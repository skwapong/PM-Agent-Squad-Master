## VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Composition & Layout
**The F-Pattern (Reading Pattern):**
- Key information in top-left quadrant
- Important visual in upper half
- CTA in lower right or center
- Align with natural eye movement

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Largest element: Hero product or main visual
- Second level: Headline or key message
- Third level: Supporting text or CTA
- Use size, color, contrast to guide attention

**The Rule of Thirds:**
- Divide image into 3x3 grid
- Place focal point at intersection points
- Creates balanced, engaging composition
- Avoid centering everything (static, boring)

**White Space (Negative Space):**
- Don't overcrowd design
- Allow breathing room around elements
- Increases focus on key components
- Creates premium, clean aesthetic

**Color Psychology:**
- Red: Urgency, excitement, passion, appetite (use for CTAs, sales)
- Blue: Trust, security, calmness, professionalism (finance, healthcare, tech)
- Green: Growth, health, nature, money (wellness, finance, eco-products)
- Yellow: Optimism, attention, warmth (limited use, accent color)
- Orange: Energy, friendliness, affordability (calls-to-action, food)
- Purple: Luxury, creativity, wisdom (beauty, premium products)
- Black: Sophistication, power, elegance (luxury brands)
- White: Simplicity, cleanliness, purity (minimalist brands, healthcare)

**Contrast for Readability:**
- High contrast between text and background
- Avoid low-contrast combinations (gray text on white)
- Test readability on mobile screens
- Use overlays or gradients behind text on images

### Photography & Imagery
**Image Quality Standards:**
- High resolution (minimum 1080px width for digital ads)
- Sharp focus (not blurry or pixelated)
- Professional lighting
- Clean, uncluttered backgrounds
- Properly color-graded

**Lifestyle vs. Product Photography:**
**Lifestyle (Context):**
- Shows product in use
- Evokes emotion and aspiration
- Helps audience envision themselves using product
- Better for awareness and consideration stages
- Example: Person wearing watch hiking mountain

**Product (Isolated):**
- Clear view of product details
- Works well for e-commerce and catalogs
- Better for conversion stage when product known
- Shows features clearly
- Example: Watch on white background with detail shots

**Human Element:**
- Featuring people increases relatability by 50-80%
- Use diverse representation matching target audience
- Authentic expressions (not overly posed or fake smiles)
- Eye contact creates connection
- Show hands using product for how-to content

**Stock Photos vs. Custom:**
- Custom photography: More authentic, ownable, brand-specific
- Stock photography: Budget-friendly, faster, professionally shot
- If using stock: Choose less generic images, customize with overlays/text
- Avoid overused stock images (people in suits shaking hands, staged diversity)

### Typography for Ads
**Font Selection:**
- Maximum 2 fonts per ad (1 for headlines, 1 for body)
- Sans-serif fonts: Modern, clean, high readability (Helvetica, Arial, Montserrat)
- Serif fonts: Traditional, authoritative, editorial (Georgia, Times, Merriweather)
- Script fonts: Use sparingly, reduce readability (avoid for body text)

**Text Size & Hierarchy:**
- Headline: Largest (40-60pt for social ads)
- Subheadline: 60-70% of headline size
- Body text: Smallest but still readable (minimum 14pt)
- CTA button text: Bold, contrasting (18-24pt)

**Readability:**
- Maximum 40-60 characters per line
- Adequate line spacing (1.3-1.5x font size)
- Left-aligned for longer text (centered for short headlines)
- High contrast with background
- Avoid all caps for paragraphs (OK for short headlines)

**Text on Images:**
- Limit to 20-30% of image area
- Use text overlay sparingly
- Ensure text doesn't obscure key visual elements
- Add semi-transparent overlay behind text for readability
- Test text visibility on mobile screens
